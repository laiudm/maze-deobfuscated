Maze
====

My attempts to deobfuscate a heavily obfuscated program found [here](http://tromp.github.io/pearls.html)

Althought the author has [explained](http://tromp.github.io/maze.html) how he obfuscated it, I still found it fun and challenging to e-obfuscate it myself.

The original code is maze0.c, and my latest version is maze.c. Intermediate versions are maze[n].c.

Lots of notes are in the source code.
